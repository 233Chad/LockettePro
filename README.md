LockettePro - A much better Lockette plugin for Bukkit

LockettePro is a block-protection plugin based on Lockette (https://github.com/Acru/Lockette). It is 100% compatable with original Lockette, and the plugin behaviors are also 100% same.

LockettePro has a lot of enhancements compared to Lockette:
1. Much better codebase.
2. Much better performance inside the code. Also boosts Hopper performance
3. Fixed a lock-breaking glitch that has not been fixed in Lockette for years.
4. All blocks can be set to lockable or not. You can even prevent players from locking a chest.
5. Unlimited [Private], [More Users], [Timer:x] signs format.
6. Alert messages are editable, and UTF-8 characters are supported.
